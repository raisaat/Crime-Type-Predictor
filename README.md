# Crime-Type-Predictor

*This was a joint project between Raisaat Rashid and Harichandana Yeleswaram*

Used Gradient Boosting and SVM models to predict the type of crime that is likely to occur at a specific location on the campus of the University of Texas at Dallas at a given time of the day.

* Generated the dataset from using a python script
* Used cross validation to select the best parameters for the models
* Generated the confusion matrices and ROC curves for each model to analyze the accuracies of the models

*Refer to "PROJECT REPORT.pdf" for more information.*
